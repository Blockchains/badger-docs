## Flow of Funds
- ETH flows into the DAO from early contributors
- The bulk of this ETH is sent to the Uniswap pool
- The DAO recieves LP tokens to reclaim this liquidity

## Scenario: Hostile Governance Takeover
Could occur if there a sufficient honeypot to incentiveize parties to take over a majority of governance process and give all funds to themselves. if the DAO burns it's LP tokens, there will be little direct ETH reward for doing so.

The main potential would be using upgradability to quietly change the implementation logic of the BASE contract, and allow them to take BASE from others. If there is sufficent liquidity out there vs other tokens, they could get away with taking BASE tokens from others' accounts and trading it before the price tanks.

However, this is where the governance comes into play. Everyone will see this vote happening. They have to have the 'support threshold' amount of tokens to insta-pass, which is 50% of tokens.

The 'support threshold' could be made impossibly high in the mature system. This would prevent 'insta-passing' from ever happening, so there would be a 7 day warning that something was going to go down.
